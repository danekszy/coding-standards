# Styleguide

#### My very own styleguide and coding standards. Mostly for my own reference and validation.

I wanted to compile my preferred guidelines and coding standards from sources such as Google and GitHub into a single place in the hope of creating a reference for all the code I write.
So why not compile it on GitHub! I can then easily update it as it evolves.

## General principles

---

- Use soft-tabs with a two space indent;
- Never compress code, that's the app/servers job;
- Keep your code clean. Seperate CSS into a .css file, JavaScript into a .js file etc;

## Table of contents

---

- [HTML](html.md)
- [CSS](css.md)
  - [SCSS](scss.md)
- [JavaScript](javascript.md)
  - [jQuery](javascript-jquery.md)

## Sources

---

- [GitHub styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/)
- [Google HTML/CSS style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml)
- [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/)


## Final thought *from Google* that I agree completely with...

Be consistent.

If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style.
If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators, you should too.
If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them, make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.

If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Avoid this.
